# UI dev task

Hey there!

Thanks for joining recruitment for UI dev @ netguru. We have a small task for you!

![Preview](https://github.com/netguru/frontend-recruitment-task/blob/master/sources/hangman.png)

This is a simple Hangman game (you can find PSD in [sources](https://github.com/netguru/frontend-recruitment-task/tree/master/sources) directory). Can you make this stuff work?

Please remember that:
+ You should provide us with link to your game and it should work out of the box (we should click link and be able to play)
+ Once youâ€™re ready to show us your work, pack everything to dropbox or drive and send the link over by email (please do not upload your solution to GitHub or any other publicly available platform)

### Rules & hints
1. Use real API for fetching random word. [WordsAPI](https://www.wordsapi.com/) could be great for that.
2. There should be no folk at game beginning. Game ends once folk earns left foot (see diverted flow below).

3. You can write your game in pure JS or use framework of your choice (React, Vue or Angular preferred).
4. Styles should be written in Sass (SCSS).
5. Using newest ECMAScript Standard is a huge plus.
6. Pay attention to code quality, formatting, conventions etc. (Your code is your business card)
7. You can find cropped images in images directory, but try not to use all of them (CSS power!).
8. Make use of keyboard as controller.
9. Game over screen is available in [sources](https://github.com/netguru/frontend-recruitment-task/tree/master/sources) directory.
10. Remember about users with retina screens.

**Good luck! If you have any questions feel free to ping us!**
